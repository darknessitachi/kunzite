Optimizer
---------

Often when one writes trading algorithms a number of input variables are specified such as number of days/ticks to
average.  To generate maximum profit these input variables are tweaked and the algorithm run against historical
data to find the most optimum input variables.  If the algorithm has a large number of input variables the search
space can quickly become too large.  This is where the **Optimizer** comes into play.  It will, using various tactics
attempt to shorten the time taken to find the most optimum set of inputs.
